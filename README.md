## vulkan-spoofer
It's for by-passing checks for GPU and enable DLSS on Vulkan with AMD/Intel GPUs.

Uses @ThirrteenAG's [Ultimate-ASI-Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)'s version.dll implementation as entry point.

### Installation
Just place it next to game executable.

*If you have other mods, you should rename mods `version.dll` to `version-original.dll` for loading it after spoofer.*
